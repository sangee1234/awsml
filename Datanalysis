DATA ANALYSIS

Seaborn
- Boxplot: its prettier box and whisker plot with many attributes
- Heatmap: colors represent magnitude
- Pairplot: visualize every combintaion (find correlation)
- Joinplot: scatterplot + histogram

RandomForestClassifier:
- a set of decision trees with lil randomness in each tree
- clf = RFC(n_est=10 #decision_trees)
  clf.fit(x, y)
  clf.predict(x)
- scikit has preprocessing models
- can wrap a model in scikitLearnEstimator using KerasClassifier
- cross_val_score to estimate: ramndom separate to train & test and average result

Types of DATA
- NUMERICAL
    quantitative measure
    discrete data
    continous( infinte possibility)

- CATEGORICAL
    it is data that has no meaning
    can assign number to category but wont have meaning

- ORDINAL
    mix of number + category    
    category that has meaning and ooorder, can be compared

DATA DISTRIBUTION
- Categorising data falling into certain range

NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
- it is a probability distribution function
- probability of given range of values

Probabilty mass function
- for discrete data
- it is a histogram

Poission distribution
- based on Poission experiment
- event can be success/ failure
- when average rate of occurence is know probabilty of event
P(event) happening a fixed amt of time = e^-lambda. lambda^x / x!

Binomial distribution
- bernoulli when #trials is 1
- 2 events exact probability of success/failure like head/tail
- and ask number of time
P(x) = nPx. p^x. (1-p)^x
