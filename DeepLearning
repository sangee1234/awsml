DEEP LEARNING

- brain structure similar to GPU
- very good use of parallelization
- Framework --> Tensorflow(Google, higher level Keras)
            --> MXNET(Apache), aws tends to support this

Activation functions
- function onsude a neuron which decides what i/p will give what o/p
- linear y=x, does nothing
- need non-linear functions to learn complex patterns, they must have useful derivatives
- sigmoid/logistic: 0 to 1
- tanh/hyper: -1 to 1 (better for data mean around 0)
- computationally expensive and lot of time near -inf and inf, slow LEARNING
- Relu: easy and fast (x if x>=0 else 0), not good for -ve values
- LeakReLU/ ParametricReLU(slope learnt through backpropagation)/ ELU
- softmax: multiple classification, converts i/p to probabilities for each class, cant give multiple classes
- sigmoid: binary or for many classes for 1 input

CNN
- feature-location invariant, doesnt depend on location, object can be anywhere in image
- inspired by visual cortex
- convolution: to chunk and process
- different filters applied for different features
- conv2D: convolution, maxpool2D: reduce to max, Flatten: 2D to 1D
- general
    conv2D --> maxppoll --> dropout --> flatten --> dense --> droupout --> softmax
- computationally intensive, lots of hyperparameters, getting training data is hard

CNN special architectures and topologies
- LeNets: good for handwritings
- ALexNet: good for image classification
- GoogleNet: deeper, better performance, incpetion (group of convolution layers)
- resNet: deeper (uses skip connections)

RNN
- for sequences, time-series data
- memory cell: more recent timestamps have more influence
- topologies    
    - seq2seq: stock price on history
    - seq2vec: words to sentiment
    - vec2seq: caption from image
    - encode-decode: seq2vec2seq (machine translation)
- is hard, need to backpropagate in time and layers
- computationally high due to many layers
- LSTM: short-term and long-term dependencies
- GRU: simplified LSTM

EMR
- supports apache MXNET and GPU instance types(P2, P3, G3)
- many APIs with libraries installed
