Kinesis

- managed alternative to kafka
- "real-time"
- data is replicated syncronously to 3 AZs
- kinesis:streams low latency streaming
- kinesis:analytics real-time analytics on streaming using sql
- kinesis:firehose load streaming to s3, redshift, es, splunk
- kinesis:videostreams

- streams -> shards/ partitions
- producers -> sh1/sh2... -> consumers
- 24hrs by deafult, upto 7 days
- multiple applications can read on own pace
- once data in, cannot be deleted (immutability)
- records upto 1MB (good for streaming data)
- producers can send upto 1 MB/s per shard else provisioned throughput exception
- consumers can take upto 2 MB/s per shard

- firehose
- fully managed no admin
- near real-time not realtime
- autoscaling
- different formats/ conversions possible
- supports compression to s3
- pay only for amount of data through firehose
- lambda transformation can be applied on firehose

Stream                                          |   Firehose
- for real-time applications                    |   - for data delivery "massive" to train algorithms
- real-time                                     |   - near real time
- custom code for producer/ consumers           |   - fully managed
- manage scaling (sharding/ merging)            |   - autoscaling
- data storage (1-7 days)                       |   - no data storage

Data Analytics
- stream ETL, metric generation, response analysis
- autoscaling
- does schema discovery
- integrates with lambda function
- Random-cut forest
    - anamoly detection on numeric columns
    - uses recent history so keeps changing
- Hotspots
    - returns information about dense regions
    - less changing

Video Streams
- 1hr to 10yrs retention
