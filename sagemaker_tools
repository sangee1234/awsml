sagemaker+spark
- spark does lot of sagemaker, but more preprocessing available
- aws has sagemaker-spark library
- preprocess data using spark, gives a dataframe
- use sagemaker estimator instead of spark MLLib
- sagemaker notebook + EMR cluster running spark
- sagemakerEstimaror() -> .fit -> .transform()

IDE -> sagemakeer studio
- intergrates many features
- intergrate with jupyter notebook, allow to share notebook

sagemakeer experiments
- have all ML jobs history in 1 place

sagemakeer debugger
- save models at intervals
- save gradients
- define rules for conditional checking
- get trainig reports
- smlibrary can be used to create hooks during trainig process
- insights dashboard for debugger
- debugger profile rule for profile
- built in actions for notifications or to stop training

autopilot

- wrapper autoML
- automatic algoselection. modeltuning, does all trial and error
- load data from s3
- select target
- automatic model creation for best prediction
- give a model notebook for visibility and control
- model leaderboard ranks model
- can deploy and monitor best notebook
- can add human guidance
- used for classification and regression, 3 algos LinearLearner, XGBoost, DL
- data must be in tabular csv

sagemaker clarify
- understand bias i.e, unbalanced data
- how different features contribute to training

sagemakeer monitor
- get alerts on quality deviation
- cloudwatch to get reports
- visuakize data drifts
- detect anomalies and new features
- no code needed

- data in s3
- set monitoring schedule
- cloudwatch
- NDCG normalized discounted cummulative gain compares features and gives ranking
